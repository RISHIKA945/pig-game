# 🎲 Pig Game

A simple and fun **two-player dice game** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Players take turns rolling the dice and can either keep rolling to increase their score or **hold** to save it.  
Rolling a **1** resets the current score and passes the turn. The first to reach **100 points** wins! 🏆

## 🕹️ How the Game Works

1. The game starts with **Player 1**.
2. On a turn, the player rolls the dice:
   - The dice number is added to their **current score**.
   - If they roll a **1**, their current score resets and the turn switches to the other player.
3. The player can choose to **“Hold”** at any time:
   - Their current score is added to their **total score**.
   - The turn then passes to the other player.
4. The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game! 🎉
